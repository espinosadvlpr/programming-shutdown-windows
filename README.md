# Programming Shutdown Windows

This software was created to work only with the windows command prompt so you can use it to program when the computer is going to shutdown, all of this is managed with GUI provided from the library Tkinter, so you need to install it before run it.

## Installation
To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your Windows computer. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/).

There is no need to install libraries because it uses only os commands, in case that you need to install `tkinter` library, you can do it using the next command:
```
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command prompt using Python:
```
python shutdown-windows.py
```
Then you'll see the tkinter gui with the options to shutdown.
